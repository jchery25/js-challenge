# Insights/Lesson Learned
- Thought it might be easier to start from scratch using html, css, and javascript. However, I quickly learned that I will most likely need to use a library like jQuery or React. Though I am more familiar with React, I wanted to challenge myself to re-learn jQuery for the specific task. 
- jQuery features were quite neat and helpful. It made the task simple and allowed me to have clean code. I wonder if React would have resulted in cleaner code and would React be a different level of difficulty to get it to work. Overall, working with jQuery shown to be challenging and exciting.
