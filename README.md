# Insights/Lesson Learned/Question
- (Insight) Thought it might be easier to start from scratch using html, css, and javascript. However, I quickly learned that I will most likely need to use a library like jQuery or React. Though I am more familiar with React, I wanted to challenge myself to re-learn jQuery for the specific task. 
- (Insight) jQuery features were quite neat and helpful. It made the task simple and allowed me to have clean code. I wonder if React would have resulted in cleaner code and would React be a different level of difficulty to get it to work. Overall, working with jQuery shown to be challenging and exciting. 
- (Question) I noticed that the beginner logo design is not the same as the finish logo design. Was that intentional?
- (Lesson Learned) I needed to manage my time better. There were too many tings going on during the week which distracted me from completing the task. I need to set a dedicated time, during late hours, where my focus can be primarily on a task with a deadline.
